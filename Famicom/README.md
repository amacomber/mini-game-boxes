# mini-game-boxes
# Famicom
Famicom cartridges measure approximately

108mm x 71mm x 17mm

or

4.25in x 2.80in x 0.67in

Famicom boxes *SHOULD* print on an 8.5" x 11" they don't because of margins.
Therefore I had to to split up the sides because the way they align.
I added an additional flap on the second side so this box needs to be glued in two places.
