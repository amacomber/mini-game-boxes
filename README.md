# mini-game-boxes
This repo is for storage of mini video game boxes.

I was tired of trying to figure out what to do with my loose video games. I had purchased a few bit-boxes but they've got a pretty large footprint compared to the original cartridges.

I decided that instead of paying $5+shipping per box I wanted to create mini game boxes out of card stock on my laser printer. 

My goal for these was to make sure the designs could either be fit onto a single sheet of 8Â½" x 11" paper or two at most. I wanted these boxes to as closely mimic their original counterparts but only be a few mm (millimeters) larger than the cart itself.

The boxes are comprised of the highest resolution scans I could find of these boxes and a little fudgery to get the remaining bits all lined up and pretty. Here are a few of the resources I used:
