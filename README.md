# mini-game-boxes
This repo is for storage of mini video game boxes.

<H1>Origin Story</H1>
I was tired of trying to figure out what to do with my loose video games. I had purchased a few bit-boxes but they've got a pretty large footprint compared to the original cartridges.

https://stoneagegamer.com/bitbox-nes-game-case.html (no kickbacks from Stone Age Gamer for this guy just a pure link)

I decided that instead of paying $5+shipping per box I wanted to create mini game boxes out of card stock on my laser printer. 

<H1>Laying the Ground Work</H1>
My goal for these was to make sure the designs could either be fit onto a single sheet of 8Â½" x 11" paper or two at most. I wanted these boxes to as closely mimic their original counterparts but only be a few mm (millimeters) larger than the cart itself.<br><p>

The boxes are comprised of the highest resolution scans I could find of these boxes and a little fudgery to get the remaining bits all lined up and pretty. 

<H1>Putting it All Together</H1>
Some boxes fold together (I use a metal ruler to pre-crease the folds) and some boxes need to be glued. I used a brush on non-generic simian-branded super glue for this project and was quite happy with the results.
